Hi, feel free to call me Icy â€” as Bingå†° in Mandarin means IceðŸ§Š.
Iâ€™m a Quantitative Analyst at RBC Capital Markets and a Master of Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. Before that, I completed a dual degree (BA + BBA + MS) at **Emory University**, graduating with Highest Academic Honor.

Iâ€™m motivated by every lightbulb moment of discovering unified understanding across data modalities â€” text, pixels, tabular, or time-series â€” especially when signals appear conflicting.
At RBC, following the bankâ€™s initiative to generate $1 billion in enterprise value from AI (source
), I build agentic systems that harness alternative signals and unstructured knowledge to drive e-trading decisions and efficiency. In research, I study multi-modal reasoning and data-centric AI, focusing on how machine learning systems integrate heterogeneous signals and reasoning patterns â€” from financial indicators to human intention modeling in vision-language models (VLMs).

Interests: Modality fusion Â· Multi-modal reasoning Â· Data-centric AI Â· Self-evolving agents
